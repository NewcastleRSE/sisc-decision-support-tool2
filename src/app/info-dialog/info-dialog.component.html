<div mat-dialog-content>
  <p>This website is part of the
    <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/spatial-inequality-and-smart-city">
      Spatial Inequality and the Smart City</a> project.
    </p>
  <p>The site has two functions: data visualisation and sensor placement decision support.
    Users can view population characteristics and spatial data that may contribute to negative air quality
    hazards, exposure and vulnerability. Users can also define priority groups to view an optimal sensor placement.
    Currently the site covers Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Gateshead Local Authority areas.
